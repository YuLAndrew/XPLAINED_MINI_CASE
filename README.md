These are 3D files for an Xplained Mini Case.
The top and bottom are a press fit.
There are two versions of the bottom of the case, one is a clean version, while the other features holes for M3 Screws with a 3mm thick head.

When cutting pin headers for the Xplained Mini, make sure that the ends don't stick out too much, as they might get caught on the top half of the case.

I originally printed my case on a Bambu A1 Mini with a 0.4mm nozzle.
